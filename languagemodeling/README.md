# Language Modeling

This example shows how to use a pre-trained BERT model for masked language modeling.

```console
go run . models
```

You can then enter a sentence and the model will predict the masked words, e.g.:

- I'm so [MASK] to talk about this topic!
- Berlin is the capital of [MASK] .
- Go is a modern [MASK] language [MASK] for its ability to [MASK] high-concurrency tasks.
