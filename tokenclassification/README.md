# Token Classification

## NER
This is a simple example using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Part-of-speech (POS) tagging.

```console
go run . models
```

You can then enter a sentence and the model will annotate the tokens accordingly, e.g.:

- My name is Matteo Grella and I live in Turin, Italy.
- The GopherCon AU conference is taking place in Sydney, Australia.
