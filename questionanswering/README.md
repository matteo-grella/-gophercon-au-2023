# Question Answering

This example shows how to use a pre-trained BERT model for question answering.

```console
go run . models
```

You can then enter a question and a context and the model will predict the answer, e.g.:

`Cloud computing is a technology that allows individuals and businesses to access computing resources over the Internet. It enables users to utilize hardware and software that are managed by third parties at remote locations. Services provided by cloud computing include storage solutions, databases, and computing power, which can be used on a pay-per-use basis. This model offers flexibility and scalability, reducing the need for large upfront investments in infrastructure. Major providers of cloud computing services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).`

Questions:

- What is cloud computing?
- What are the benefits of cloud computing?
- What are the major providers of cloud computing services?
